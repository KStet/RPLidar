# RPLidar
A Python program made to interact with the RPLidar [Product] (http://www.robotshop.com/en/rplidar-a1m8-360-degree-laser-scanner-development-kit.html) <br /><br />

Currently:
* Stops motor when program is run
* Start motor
* Stop motor
* Start Scan (this just scans 60 rotations then graphs for now)

Todo:
* Make Start Scan run in background then they put Stop Scan and that stops the scan and graphs the points
* Realtime graph
* Data Sanitation
* Data Correlation
* Movement data based on surroundings
